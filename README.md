# ADVANCED_HOSPITAL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
# 🏥 AI-Based Hospital Management & Token System (Java)

This is an advanced Hospital Management System built in **Java**, featuring an intelligent **AI Triage Engine**, **doctor-wise assignment**, **QR token generation**, **SMS alert simulation**, **file-based storage**, and a full **Java Swing GUI**.

It works like a real hospital OPD system by automatically analyzing symptoms, deciding priority levels, assigning doctors, generating QR tokens, and notifying patients.
